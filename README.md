# Battleship
Battleship simulation written in Java.

This program works by running two files. 

There is a server file which is used to create the game and open a socket for connection between two clients.

There is a client file which creates the client GUI and connects to the server through the open socket.

To play the game, the server file must be up and running to open the socket. Then two client files must connect to the socket to allow for a multiplayer game to take place.
